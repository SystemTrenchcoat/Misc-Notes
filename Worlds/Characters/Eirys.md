## Scientific Doctor in a Magical Land

A mortal born to elvish parents, Eirys (Eir for short) spent much of their time learning. Elves in their village were skilled researchers with strong ethics. They saw the value of all life, and insist on prioritizing it above anything else.

Eirys wanted deeply to heal people, it called to them. However, they could not cast as most medical practitioners did, so, he researched how to mend and heal without magic. With science and logic as their back bone, they discovered what magic did, how to emulate it, and even a village of vedalken who were creating tools and machines for it.

He studied with the vedalken from a young age, spending most of their life studying with and helping, those vedalken. They tested devices, started applying his research, and even assisted in creating some devices. Their time with the vedalken was transformative. Over time, they adopted more vedalken ideologies, eventually altering their form, granting them pale blue skin, and even the ability to consume energy like vedalken. Even so, the compassion he was taught lives on inside them, making him one of the most well loved doctors in Eotal.
