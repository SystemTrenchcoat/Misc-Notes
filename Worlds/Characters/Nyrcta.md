## Face of the Faceless

Neither born a ruler nor creator of their own nation, Nyrcta earned her place among her city's council. One of only a handful of survivors of her original village, she was orphaned as a child. The survivors stuck together, fled to a nearby city, but their lives were still hard. Changelings in general are viewed as dangerous most places, but especially feral ones. They were ostracized by most, but Nyr was taken in by local civilized changelings who taught them all sorts of things. How the city worked, how to take on a more appeasing form, and the difficulties for their kind in civilization. Hearing their plights, seeing their hardship, experiencing it first hand, they were driven to change the city by any means necessary.
