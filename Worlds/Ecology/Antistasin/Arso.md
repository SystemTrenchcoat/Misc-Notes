Colloquially called The Tamers, they are somewhat hairy quadrupeds skilled at climbing, burrowing, and befriending even the most ferocious predators. These intelligent creatures often live as they do, each tribe gaining a related ability. Additionally, their sensitive taste buds can be calibrated to taste many things, from poison to prey, often determined by their animal families.
