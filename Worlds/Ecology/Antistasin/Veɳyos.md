Known for their brightly colored scales, these amphibians are the most poisonous people in the forest. When predators attempt to eat them, they would detach the limb at the nearest joint and run off, killing their predator as they escaped. Additionally, their poison can be used to remedy most natural toxins, making them excellent medical practitioners.
