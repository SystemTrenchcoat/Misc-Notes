- Bountiful in life, cover, and water; generally the easiest [Mythican](Mythica) province to live

- Trees suggest a climbing ability, maybe for cover, maybe for surveying, maybe for food

- Lots of food means lots of poison, so maybe poison detection or resistance

- Defenses/Offenses
	- Hiding
		- Through camouflage
		- Burrowing
		- Could be good for predators or prey
	- Poison
		- Blood (maybe it's also an anti-venom)
		- Maybe secretion
		- Maybe bites
	- Befriending predators, perhaps attaining symbiosis
