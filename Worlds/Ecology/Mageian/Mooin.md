A people blessed for their undying service to cows, mooins are predominantly herbivores. Descended from hunter gather's who utilized mageian cow fur for clothing, they are protectors of herds across Mageia.

Their predecessors protected herds from multitudes of predators, eating the beasts and plants they found. When cows began getting old and slowing down, they took it upon themselves to kill them mercifully and make full use of it, making stews, steaks, jerky, and jewelry out of them. Over time, herds grew along with the proto-mooin's magical prowess, they marked each of the cows with custom flower crowns, making differentiating them easier.

Modern mooins still mark cows with flower crowns and still protect them from predators, though it is less common to eat them. After living along side them for so long, they became more like cows, growing horns, seasonal coats, and the ability to graze. As such, most don't eat meat, though a few ritualistically consume elder cows in celebration of life rituals. The ornaments made are used in various rituals from worship, to communion, to empowerment.

Mooins are naturally magic inclined, innately learning spells like ==druidcraft, speak with animals, and beast sense,== most of which are also taught ritualistically by shamans. Additionally, it is also standard for each mooin to protect a cow throughout its life, many casting an elaborate ritual on them to both awaken it and extend its life, tying it to the caster's.

Though they mostly live in the wilds of Mageia, they do occasionally practice trade with cities for apothecarist and alchemical supplies, rare herbs, and other exotic goods difficult to come by in the wilds. In return, they trade clothing, dyed and natural textiles, dyes, preserved plants and meat, as well as bones from predators.
