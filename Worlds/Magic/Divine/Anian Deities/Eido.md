The duty-driven ferrier of souls. Committed solely to his work, he disdains anything that gets in its way. He disdains all things that interupt the dead's endless respite. He is immensely pragmatic, somewhat apathetic, and highly duty-bound. His preferred "mortal" form is a tall, gaunt man with pale skin, long straight, silver hair, lavender eyes, and ethereal skeletal wings.
