The sanguine cult leader. One of the most active [Anian deities](Ani), at least in reference to interacting with mortals, she shows up through history teaching the wisdom locked within blood. Upon creating her following, she guides them in her ways until their numbers grow too thin and she reemerges to repeat the cycle. She is charismatic, patient, and wise, completely devoted to her teachings. She often appears as an older human woman with tan skin, covered in strange tattoos, long. dirty blonde hair kept in a bun atop her head, and deep tyrian purple eyes.
