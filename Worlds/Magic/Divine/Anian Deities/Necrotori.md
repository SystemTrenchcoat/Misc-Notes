The queen of spite and goddess of undeath. Every undead, risen of their own will or that of a necromancer, draw from Necrotori to maintain their form. She cares not the reason nor the means, if a creature is called from the afterlife, she brings them back to form. She is ebullient and easy-going, if a bit reckless. She usually takes the form of a decomposing gnome woman with incorporeal skulls bulging from her skin, dirt, tangled hair that drags across the ground, and midnight violet eyes with black scelaras and white pupils.
