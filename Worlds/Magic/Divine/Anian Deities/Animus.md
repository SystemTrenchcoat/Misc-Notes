The soft, yet somber, keeper of memory. The last influence many feel before passing over, they bring the painful reminder "Momento Mori," but also the nostalgic one of a life well lived. They are known to show great kindness and comfort to mortals in their most trying times, offering fond memories of their dearly deceased and is known to aid ailing souls pass on. They are a gentle, kind being who sees all through the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia. The form they take often resembles a deceased lobed on of the observer, however, they occasionally take on a form of their own: a somewhat tall androgynous halfling with slightly tanned skin, medium length wavy hair (about shoulder length) and orchid colored eyes.
