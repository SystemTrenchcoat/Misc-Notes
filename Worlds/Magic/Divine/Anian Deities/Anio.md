The master of the self. The embodiment of introspection, they deity and keeper of the [ani](Ani), they near solely focus on connecting to and understanding the world on the deepest level. Perhaps ironically however, they scarcely engage people, divine or mortal. They are quite isolationist, only vaguely interested in creatures who have achieved seemingly impossible feats, and only in how they were accomplished, not in the creature itself. When they do take a mortal form, they appear as a spirit [[eleokara]] with dark lavender skin, with light circles down their arms, geometric patterns along their back and bald head, two brilliant purple eyes and one crystalline one.
