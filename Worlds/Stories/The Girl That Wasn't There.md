It was a brisk autumn noon in the mountains. A cool breeze swept through the warm colored trees as the [[Iosa Tribe]] fanned out in search of food. Young [[Gyir]]'s parents had been teaching them what to forage for and what to avoid, so with a small spear and a basket, the young [[ion-kin]] set off for his first solo forage.

Young [[Ion-kin|jorgen-kin]] are taught weapon use shortly after walking and foraging around that same time. While children this young aren't brought to hunts, they are taught basic combat for emergency scenarios when foraging. [[Gyir]] was no different, and was eager to explore the mountain's forests alone for the first time, so with starry eyes, they set out into the wilderness. 

He walked the paths his parents showed him a dozen times now with ease and confidence, collecting berries, herbs, nuts, and even mushrooms as they had been since autumn began, until he found something strange: A stone path leading deep into the forest.

He sat bewildered for a moment as he retraced his route in his head, wondering where he made a wrong turn, then, after surveying for a moment, realized he hadn't, and that somehow, it just appeared. Quickly coming to terms with this, curious child that he was, he followed the path.

The deeper they got, the more they came to notice a strange feeling. He would not understand this feeling too well yet, but it was almost like being watched. The strange sensation only exhilarated them, almost propelling them forward.

Following the trail diligently, the feeling only grew, like more eyes were turned on them. Something deep inside screamed to turn back, while the strange gaze from nowhere only beckoned him forth. [[Gyir]] continued forward, entranced by the strangeness, or perhaps something else...

Eventually, the trail came to an end, and the trance alone with it. [[Gyir]] quickly came back to their senses and looked around, finding themselves before a strange cavern with ancient giant runes etched around the mouth and a stone with several runes carved in it like a message.

[[Gyir]] finally started to feel nervous in this moment, eyes darting to the strange markings while their insides screamed to run as something else begun to draw them in once more. Their feet moved on their own, the crunching of leaves drowned out by his heart pounding in their chest, but just before he could step past the threshold, he felt a warm hand on his shoulder.

He didn't flinch, and in moments, felt both the fear and pull fade to but a faint whisper. When he turned to thank whomever stopped them, they saw a girl, not even a year older than him with the same markings as the rest of [his tribe](Iosa%20Tribe).

"Looks like you got a bit lost, let's get back." She said sweetly, smiling as she started leading him back down the path. [[Gyir]] just followed dumbfounded as this strange girl led him back to the camp.

When they returned, his parents quickly spotted them and raced over for a hug.

"Where have you been? It's been hours!!!"

"You are staying by our side until the ancestors pull us away!" His parents yelled, fear and relief filling their words.

"R-right... I-I just got a bit lost b-" [[Gyir]] started before looking around, "but some girl brought me back..." he finished, realizing she was gone.

He asked his parents if they knew of her, giving them a description, but they just shook their heads (after a long lecture of course). He then asked around camp, but no one seemed to know of the girl, nor a stone path leading to a cavern in the forest. Left with more questions than answers, he simply thanked the ancestors he made it back safe, though when he did, he felt that same calm, with no strange hand nor girl to be found.
