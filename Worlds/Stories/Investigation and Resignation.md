Gazing out at the death and devastation before them, a distraught [[Karmen]] fell to their knees and screamed. The land itself seemed to flinch at the sound, shaken by the anguish it carried. All fell silent in anticipation for what would come next.

It took quite some time for [[Karmen]] to stand, face frozen with icy tears, but eventually, she brought herself to explore the remnants of what was once his home. He knew the people were gone, but hoped to find something to remember them by.

From the ruins and lack of supplies, they were near certain that [[orcs]] conducted a raid and left almost nothing behind. However, they did find one thing secured in an illusioned lock-box: a large amethyst crystal, swirling with an eerie energy.

Documents beneath it called it a "soul siphon," a crystal that drew in the souls of all who died around it. It was described as a power source, but [[Karmen]] just saw it as his entire camp preserved with her no matter where she went.

She followed the tracks in the snow as best the could, the crystal in his pocket seemingly driving them to their murderers and in no time, over the horizon, was an [[orc]] camp.

Karmen grabbed their gifted rifle, inlaid with runes glowing in the presence of the crystal, and took aim. With a slight squeeze, a flash of purple pierced an [[orc]], seemingly manifesting another bullet that pierced the next, cascading on and on, burning through the camp like wildfire.

She stood for a moment, dumbfounded, before realizing the weight of their actions. The [[Orc|orcs]] would likely retaliate, so he knew they had to warn the [[Vedal]] and flee, so they did. Traversing to the mountains and the provinces beyond, warning camps of [[Vedal]] along the way. Thus began the story, or perhaps, legend, of Karmen, scourge of the mighty, voice of the dead and voiceless
