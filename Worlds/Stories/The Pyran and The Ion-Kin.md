The mountains were a home for the heartiest folk in ancient times, often limited only to varying kinds of [[Ion-kin]], though outliers always exist. [[Eris]] was an early example, a [fire-born](Eleokara) who insists upon training in the harshest locales. She trekked up the [[Syngrou Mountains]], only surviving on the land, scavenging, foraging, and killing what she needed. Several years were spent like this before they were met with a truly unique encounter.

[[Krion]], the Lone Hunter, was out seeking the biggest game he could when he happened across a mountain lion. Raring for a fight, the [jotunn-kin](Ion-kin) approached, not realizing the creature was preoccupied. Approaching with blades in hand, he realized he was literally beaten to the punch as the [pyran](Eleokara) dealt a powerful blow to the beast's throat as it attacked, leaving a searing mark in its fur. The feline hissed and recoiled but the [pyran](Eleokara) stood their ground, swiftly landing a second punch to her prey's eye and a kick to its jaw, leaving the creature motionless on the cold mountain stone.

The [[Ion-kin]] stood in shock. Perhaps some part of him was impressed, inspired even, but the only emotion that crossed his awareness was rage at the stolen kill. He shouted at the stranger, a being unlike any he's seen, demanded to fight her in the beast's stead. However, the [pyran](Eleokara) didn't understand his shouts as she had never needed to learn the [giant-kin's](Ion-kin) language. In a series of crackles and hisses, they told him to take the beast and went off to find another.

[Krion's](Krion) rage only increased; "first this creature steals my kill, then walks away from a fight!?" The thoughts howled in his head as he raced after the disrespectful creature, roaring his battle cry for the entire mountain to hear. [[Eris]] looked back hearing this, just in time to narrowly parry the attack by ducking and striking his arm.

Thus, the battle ensued, both warriors refusing to give an inch, both fighting with their lives and pride on the line. Though they both fought valiantly, a cleverly timed kick from [[Eris]] left [[Krion]] unable to continue. She bowed to her opponent, a sign of respect for his skill, and disappeared further up the mountain as [[Krion]] was forced not only to admit defeat, but to swallow his pride left with only a choice: accept her prey, or return to his tribe empty-handed.
