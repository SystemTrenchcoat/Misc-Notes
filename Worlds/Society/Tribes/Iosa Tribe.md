The Iosa tribe of [[jorgen-kin]] are known for their deep family roots and their stories featuring the stars. The stories, both of the stars and of many ancestors, are shared throughout youth as fables, but at age 10, the young are taught to seek the ancestors for guidance in times of need with rituals. That aside, they were a standard nomadic people who lived in the mountains, utilizing sacred paths with astronomical significance (mirroring astronomical alignments and leading to various observation places).
