## Overview

A large seafaring village with canals instead of streets. The village takes their seafaring ways very seriously, teaching their children to fish from a young age, often being considered as important as education. In addition, all villagers are taught to swim well, as well as how to properly captain gondolas to get around. Additionally, they are known for their amazing seafood. To many, "The Roaring Kraken" is the king of seafood of all of Eotal.
