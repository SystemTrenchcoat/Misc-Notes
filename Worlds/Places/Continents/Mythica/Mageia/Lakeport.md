## Overview

A moderate sized seafaring village that lies near the border of a [[triton]] settlement. The two had a decent business relationship for a while, but eventually, the [[triton]] demanded more and more, going to war over it. The [[triton]] wanted the land to have a hunting ground for sentient creatures. The villagers wouldn't let that happen, and as such, were forced to become soldiers, trained by the royal guard. After 3 long years and countless casualties on both sides, a treaty was signed between the two, allowing for peace to be restored. Now, there is a monument on the shores of this bloodiest battle, to remember those that were lost.
