Endless trees in every direction with every variety of plant accompanying them. This beautiful forest almost feels magical with its thriving plants and awakened beasts. This region is filled with creatures with a deep love and respect for nature. From the [[Antistasi Village]] full of hunters and retired adventurers to the inhabitants of the [[Animal Village]]. The hunters of Antistasi use every part of the animal, not letting any of it go to waste, and being certain to only hunt out of necessity. The locals understand the balance that must be kept in this magical forest. This land's simplistic rules make it a hot spot for retired adventurers looking to settle down. There is also a [tribe](The%20Briogian-Kin.md) that travels around the forest, worshiping [The Embodiment of Nature](Briosa) the spirits and [creatures that protect it](Fae)
