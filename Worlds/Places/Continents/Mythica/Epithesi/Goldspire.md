## Overview

A small village populated with worshipers of the goddess [[Divini]]. There are next to no issues as those who would go against [[Divini]]'s order are driven away, repelled by her influence. Likewise, those who would do the village harm seem to get lost on the way, unable to find her holy land. The village is blessed by [[Divini]], and as such, the people are allowed a peaceful life until they leave. Even so, nearly all villagers are devout worshipers and clerics of [[Divini]] and are under her protection anyway. Unlike most villages, thanks to [[Divini]], this village is a little slice of The [[Realm of Kindness]].
