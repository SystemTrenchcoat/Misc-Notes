## Overview

A town of misfits and outlaws with a little twist. This wild west town has a bit of a ghost problem. None who die here are permitted rest, they simply come back by dusk, bound to the town with an eternity to settle their scores. Interestingly, the spirits don't return to their homes for respite, but to the deep blue lake near the edge of town from which the name stems
