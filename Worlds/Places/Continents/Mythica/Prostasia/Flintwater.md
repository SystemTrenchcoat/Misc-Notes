## Overview

A town near the southwest edge [[Prostasia]] tundra with canals instead of streets. Despite what the name may imply, the waters are quite clean. The town is primarily a place for passing ships to dock. The primary businesses in town are carpentry, specifically shipwright's galley, and the numerous fish markets. The town is small, but the community is strong. The villagers come together for events such as birth days and anniversaries to celebrate. The townsfolk are like a family in that sense.
