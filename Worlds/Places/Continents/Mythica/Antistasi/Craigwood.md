## Overview

A decent sized town named after the tyrant that rules over the place. The tyrant stomps out anyone who expresses any level of disdain for him, taking anything they own on "his" land. As a result, the streets are filled with beggars, all people who showed how little they liked the tyrant. Even under the power hungry tyrant however, the town became the center of trade for fungi of all things. The town exports strange fungi that can be consumed if cooked, made into a poison or drug if properly prepared, and is especially useful for certain spells. Somewhat recently, it was discovered that there was a cave swarming with monsters beneath the town. As a result, adventurers have been coming en masse. Strangely, trade has slowed as a result, much to the displeasure of the tyrant.
