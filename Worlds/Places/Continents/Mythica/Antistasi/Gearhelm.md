## Overview

A city suspended above one of many lakes in [[Antistasi]]. The citizens used to reside along the lake, but according to [one faction](Children%20of%20Nature), the were causing a problem to the forests. The engineers in town decided that they were not ready to leave just because some druids said instead, created a machine to suspend the buildings over the lake, as well as a few walkways. The [faction](Children%20of%20Nature) did not take kindly to this, and cursed the village. As a result, it is now plagued by hatred and violent storms, leaving the town at constant risk of falling into the lake.
