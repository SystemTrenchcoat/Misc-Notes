## Overview

One of the largest castle towns in all of [[Mythica]] and located in the forest province of Antistasi; [[Rhimeheld]] is one of the oldest settlements in [[Mythica]]. This wealthy town has some of the best defenses in [[Mythica]] from the skilled works of the [Mageian](Mageia) mages to the various engineers scattered across the land. The town is filled and ruled by the noble and ultra-wealthy who use the poor as slaves. The nobles predominantly own the land, but some of them gained their status through their invaluable creations (such as jewelers and metal workers).
