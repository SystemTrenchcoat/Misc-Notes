## Overview

A quiet town in Southwest [[Antistasi]], nearing both the [Syngrou] and [[Rathei Mountains]]. The location of the town (known as Midrain) burrow through [[Rathei Mountains|Rathei]] to [[Epithesi]]. [[Midrain Landing|Midrain]] gets its name from the near constant rains in the area. The area is surrounded by waterfalls since many of [[Antistasi]]'s rivers converge at this place. However, as a result, it storms often. The town itself is quiet, but the [[Syndicate]] took advantage of the foolish leader and implement a small black market outpost nearing the caverns towards [[Epithesi]]. Its location makes it valuable to many nearby towns as it is near one of the least treacherous roads into [[Epithesi]], or [[Mageia]] for that matter. The area is also filled with wildlife and plants which are used by the herbalist and to feed the town.
