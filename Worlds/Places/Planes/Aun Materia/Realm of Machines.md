All serving the one mind, the machines mindlessly march on. Some may witness the bliss of freedom, but here, all know their purpose and serve it. A few may uphold the One Mind's law, though for their power they are reduced to puppets, attempts for the immensely powerful being to understand a life of a separate self.
