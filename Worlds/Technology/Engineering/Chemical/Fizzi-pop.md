Music and meade are a truly magical pair, but what if meade, or alcohol in general were outlawed? A small village in [[Epithesi]] did exactly this, much to the chagrin of the people, but they found something else to sate this craving.

Fizzi-pop is a fizzy alchemical that is unremarkable on its own, except for its unique fizz (like modern soda), but when paired with the right song, it has a wide range of magical effects from every school of magic. The school is determined by the specific pop, but each responds differently to each song.

It is standard practice for one fizz to react poorly to any song just in case there was someone they needed to neutralize at the establishment for any reason. It is engineered to react uniquely to a string of motifs and chords such that it can enact ecstasy upon some and fear and pain upon others.

It is rare to see this alchemical outside the village that created it, but its unique effects has inspired its share of copycats.
