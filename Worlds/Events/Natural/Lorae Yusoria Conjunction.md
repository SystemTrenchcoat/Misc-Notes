When the light of the sun passes Yusoria and the lorae of Eotal align perfectly, the realm is bathed in a brilliant purple light. From orchid or phlox on the tomer lit side, to the deep, dark lavender of the lorae lit side, the whole realm is brought into a trance as all is bathed in a strange understanding. Lives overtaking their every thought that they had no prior knowledge of, ghosts and incorporeal undead of those who look over the Eotalian Material Plane, even the spirits of extraplanar beings that exist atop this space are made visible.

Most who experience this rare spiritual experience believe it to be a dream, however, if one is of strong enough mind, they can recall the event for what it was and learn from it.

This is also commonly referred to as "Phantom Sky" for its otherworldly hue and presence of spirits. It opens a path for all creatures to see into any and every incarnation they have ever had from a place where all time occurs at once. This gives a few, those wise and mentally strong enough to brave the rush of information, the ability to learn from these lives and/or communicate with the beings manifested from the comfort of Eotal, free of planar travel.
