## The Beginning

Agonrae were made ~150 years prior to Eotal's present to brave the craziest and deadliest environs and weather. Designed primarily for varying kinds of excavation, they were made to be durable and easy to repair. For a few years, all operated as intended, relatively mindless drones, but over time, they learned and adapted, becoming sentient in their own right.

Early on, there were remarkably few problems. They were, perhaps surprisingly, ok with their jobs, despite the dangers. Most simply wanted breaks, time to examine, develop, and learn themselves and their interests which many were more than willing to give them, especially because there were enough Agons and few enough projects with need for their services that shift work for the was manageable. For those reluctant, they began to realize a decline in efficiency as Agons would simply rest in their environs, eventually leading to universal standards for Agon workers.

The real issue came when Agons interacted with others. These immensely durable, easily repairable beings were used to harsh treatment and assumed such was standard. However, over time (and much intervention) they learned that not all are nigh indestructible.
