## The Silver-Tongued Temptress

As a siren, Yra always knows exactly what those around her want. This gives her an edge in negotiations as she always knows just which buttons to push, just what offer to make, just what consequence to threaten to get what she wants. Yra is an incredibly skilled information broker with an extraordinary edge over others in her business. She is seen as cutthroat, even by the sirens. Rumor has it, she sold another out to build rapport with other races. Regardless of the truth of this statement, it did aid her reputation, though the clients saw and used her more like a tool than a person. Sirens, in contrast, see her through a lens of rage, disgust, and envy, as even with her alleged betrayal, she has more influence over others than most could even dream of. As such, all of them seek her "throne". She has only her business circle to speak of, but she seems fine with it. Her business runs better if she only has herself anyway.
