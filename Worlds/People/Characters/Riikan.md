## [Arcanics](Rune%20Engineering.md) Hacker Extraordinaire

Riikan was always surrounded by chaos. Be it the natural unpredictability of the ever changing-lands, the utter insanity of their clan, or the bizarre travelers the clan would often offer refuge to. Riik had gotten almost used to being surrounded by strangers, those who could be considered insane, etc., but it never bothered him. If nothing else, the weirdos and insane clan-folk she called family was, if nothing else, amazing at parties. Riika thrived here, surrounded by her strange family and the stranger outsiders. They quite loved the guests especially as they always brought interesting stories and even more interesting technology they would let her study. 

Over time, Riika cultivated an expansive understanding of engineering and the arcane through nothing more than the small encounters with the stuff he was gifted on occasion. In no time, they started to see patterns across the machines, even though many were quite different. He would experiment for days in attempts to isolate effects, then eventually combine them with others out of sheer curiosity. 

These combination experiments gained Riik a reputation around the clan as a trouble maker. Countless travels were interrupted by explosions and spontaneous transformations, but eventually, he perfected this art. Over time, they created a wide variety of trinkets for the clan, but the experiments didn't stop at creation.

Mastering this strange art, they decided to push it even further. Following their success in creation, they tried to take control of these machines through separate devices with scary success. Sometimes it would be her own, others it would be the travelers, but regardless, they were known throughout the lands as a menace for his skill, and they relished in this reputation.
