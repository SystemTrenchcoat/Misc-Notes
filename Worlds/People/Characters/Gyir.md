## [[Ion-kin|Jorgen-kin]] Summoner

Gyir has always had strong ties with the non-physical world. His tribe has strong ties with their ancestors, leaning on them to guide and teach through ritual and dream. Most of the tribe only seek out the ancestors in times of confusion, but Gyir took a different approach. Instead of reaching out only in times of need, he reached out near daily. They were intrigued by the wisdom of the ancestors and wanted to learn from them like teachers instead of distant guides. This taught Gyir all kinds of things :ancestral magic, familial stories, and ancient allies. They taught him about celestial allies and ancient spells to commune with them. Through studying these spells, he learned to summon aspects of his allies and ancestors. Their connection to this unseen world is everything to him, and he treasures it greatly.
