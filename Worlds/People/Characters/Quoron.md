## The Tide Danseur

Quoron is known throughout the Eotalian Coast for her moving performances, literally. It is said her dances are so evocative that the tide itself moves to her will. The star beyond the shore adores her performances above all else. "Truthfully, the crowds and fans only get in the way, but they make performing a little more interesting," is her philosophy on the matter. She performs to commune with the seas themselves and greatly values all that aid in this solitary aim.

Despite her determination to enhance her craft, she does sometimes enjoy meeting new people. She strongly prefers those who aren't fans of hers, but exceptions do exist. Those confidants grant her a semi-normal social life, and often end up leading her to new inspiration.
