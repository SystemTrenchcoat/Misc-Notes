## Bard of Vengeance and Remembrance

The bard Karmen was not always a bard, not really. They started as a researcher, a purveyor, a lover, of music. Born to a camp of [[Vedal]] known for weapon production, he never quite fit in. There was, of course, the love of music, and disinterest in weapons research, but mostly, it was her empathy. Vedal are known to be quite stoic and detached, but she always had a well of expression, even if they learned to express it less.

Regardless, some years before they became a fairly recognizable figure, they set off on a country wide excursion to study their craft across [[Mythica]], as many of his people do, but tragedy struck in their absence. He returned to the camp in decimation, the tents ravaged, the weapons taken, and Karmen left alone.

With the rifle he was gifted prior to leaving in hand, they vowed to see justice served, that no village would suffer like her camp, and that the world would know the greatness of their family.
